Hey there, I'm Rafaela! 👋
I'm a soon-to-be IT graduate with a passion for turning data into gold (well, insights, but they're just as valuable!).

What I'm all about 🚀
- Digging into data to uncover hidden gems of information
- Bridging the gap between tech speak and business talk
- Always learning new ways to make data work smarter, not harder

My toolbox 🛠️ 
I'm constantly sharpening my skills in:
- Python 🐍
- SQL 📊
- BI tools 📈

A fact about me ⚡
When I'm not crunching numbers, you might find me solving puzzles, watching some crime series or at the beach.
Stay tuned for some data magic! ✨
